# | # Emoji Sentiment Analysis
# |
# | In his notebook I explore how emojis are related to the sentiment in each comment.
# |
# | Just around 5% of the comments contain emojis.
# | The most common emojis in the training set are: ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤” ðŸ¤© ðŸ¤˜ ðŸ¤— ðŸ¥°.
# |
# | Messages may have the same emoji repeated several times but,
# | in general, they have just one emoji.
# | Some comments have 2 emojis and very few have 3.
# |
# | Individual emoji counts are very small within each of the sentiment groups
# | and trends cannot be guaranteed. Said that,
# | ðŸ¤© seems to be associated with Positive messages while
# | ðŸ¤£ ðŸ¤” are more common in Negative or Mixed feelings.
# | ðŸ¤˜ seems to be a good marker of non Tamil languages.
# | Nevertheless, none of the emojis on its own seems to be able to discriminate among groups.
# | Moreover, as very few comments contain 2 or more emojis we will not be able
# | to fit complex models to predict sentiment just based on emojis.
# |
# | In __conclusion__, emojis will incorporate information to any predictive model we may want to use for our sentiment analysis.
# | Hence, it will be a good practice then to try to incorporate them in our NLP modeling.
# | But, on their own, they will not yield a good model, first because they are only in 5% of the messages
# | so we will not be able to predict the 95% of messages that do not have emojis.
# | Second because they do not have enough predictive power on their own
# | and they are generally not combined in the messages so we cannot create a more complex signal.
